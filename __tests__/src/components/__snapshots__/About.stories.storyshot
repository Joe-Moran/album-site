    xRGB is a MI-based multi-instrumentalist. Refraction is his debut album,
    and the result of years of adequate agonizing. 11 sonic journal entries
    without the crutch of vocals. A restless mixtape from a bedroom humanoid
    aching to get on a stage. Yesâ€¦HUMAN. More playing. Less spacebar. More
    strumming. Less laptop.
