          <p>
            Thank you so much for your support and love and whatever else you've been secretly sending me without my knowing. 
          </p>
           
          <p>
            Sound design is a huge part of my creative process, so I felt I needed to share some of my sounds with you, the artist. I hope you gain inspiration within these files, but if you find the sounds uninspiring, dull, or pointless, then hell yeah! Sometimes it requires a hell of a picky ear to translate or find inspiration for a sound or song, so I'm happy knowing I can help you sound less shitty than some of my worst songs ever. 
          </p>
           
          <p>
            I hope you are writing some sick fucking jams and have as much fun as I did while writing my album Refraction.
          </p>
           
          <p>
            Thanks for listening! 
            <br />
