        "I wake up. I feel like I don't exist. Trailing hands grip my face in the morning light. Yep. That's real. The clock on the wall pierces my ears and I wonder which hand am I. Today will I crawl through each hour, repeating the the prior numbers and interwining them with what lies ahead? Will I dash quickly around the house, with every movement causing loud exclamation of what I'm doing and where I'm going? Or is everything still? I think today I forgot to it all. I'm having a hard time pulling my hands from my face not because I don't want to, but because I won't know what to do with them. Sometimes my limbs move by themselves. Thank fucking god for that because any time wasted, any time staying still would start this entire process over.",
